## Ask a question

Remember:

* Please make your question as clear and specific as possible.
* Please check that the documentation does not answer your question.
* Please search in both open and closed issues to check that your question has not already been answered.

### Include your code

Usually the best way to ask a clear question and get a quick response is to show your code. Preferably, attach a small,
runnable project or post a small, runnable code listing that reproduces what you are seeing.

Use triple-tick code fences for any posted code. For example:

```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

### Include stack traces

Include the full exception message and stack trace for any exception you encounter.

Use triple-tick fences for stack traces. For example:

```
Unhandled exception. System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

   at SixFour.Main() in C:\Stuff\AllTogetherNow\SixFour\SixFour.cs:line 54
